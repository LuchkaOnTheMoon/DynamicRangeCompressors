# Static Curve Measurements
All .wav files in this folder must be stereo and contain IN signal track (1kHz amplitude sweep) on LEFT channel, and recorded dynamic range compressor OUT signal track on RIGHT channel.
File naming convention is the following: 
{Compressor name or model}_Ratio_{Selected compression ratio}_Knee_{Default, Soft, Hard, ...}.wav
Attack and release times must be set to the lowest possible values available, and threshold, input gain, output gain, make-up gain must be set to achieve an undistorted output signal and an appreciable gain reduction.
